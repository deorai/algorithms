/*

The primePrinter() function takes in a number num as an argument and returns the sum of all prime numbers less than or equal to **`num`**. Here's what it does step by step:

1. It creates an empty array called **`array`** that will be used to store the prime numbers found.
2. It defines a function called **`isPrime()`** that takes in a number **`n`** and returns **`true`** if **`n`** is a prime number and **`false`** otherwise. This function checks if **`n`** is less than 2, which means it cannot be a prime number, and returns **`false`** in that case. If **`n`** is greater than or equal to 2, it loops through all numbers from 2 to **`n`** - 1 and checks if **`n`** is divisible by any of those numbers. If it is, it returns **`false`** because **`n`** is not a prime number. If **`n`** is not divisible by any of the numbers, it returns **`true`** because **`n`** is a prime number.
3. It loops through all numbers from 0 to **`num`** and checks if each number is prime using the **`isPrime()`** function. If the number is prime, it adds it to the **`array`** of prime numbers.
4. It calculates the sum of all the numbers in the **`array`** of prime numbers and returns it.
